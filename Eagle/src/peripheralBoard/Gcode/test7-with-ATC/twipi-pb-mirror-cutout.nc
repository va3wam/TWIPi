(Description:)
(Mill the cut out for version 7 of the TWIPi peripheral PCB board.)
(Files was generated in FlatCAM then manually updated to use PathPilot tool offsets)

(History:)
(2018-10-31: Test7 FlatCAM file updated with ATC and related G-codes by hand)

N01(Setup job. G-Codes do the following...)
(Absolute distance mode)
(Coordinate system 1)
(Maintain defined feed velocity)
(Reset all scale factors to 1)
(XY-plane as active)
(Cutter compensation off)
(Cancel all canned cycles)
(Set active feed rate to units per minute)
(Incremental distance mode for I and K offsets, return I and K to their default behaviour)
(Cancel tool length compensation)
G90 G54 G64 G50 G17 G40 G80 G94 G91.1 G49
G20 (Inch)
G30 (Rapid traverse to saved absolute position)

N10(Retrieve engraving tool used for copper traces)
(Tool change code does the following...)
(Tool 4 â€“ 1/16 end mill bit)
(Apply tool length offset)
(Tool number associated with length of tool specified by number - same as T above)
(Tool change)
T4 G43 H4 M6 

N11(Move to Z start position, kick off Fog Buster and start spindle)
G00 Z0.1000 (Rapid move to Z start position)
M8 (Start Flood Coolant. Note Fog Buster connect to flood coolant control on our machine)
F3.50 (Set feed rate of 3.5 IPM)
M03 S10000 (Rotate spindle clockwise at 10,000 RPM) 
G4 P1 (Dwell for 1 second to allow spindle to get up to speed)
